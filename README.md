# Liver Resection Zone Prediction

<!-- This is a comment and won't appear in the rendered README -->

<!--  --- -->

## Short Description
Trained pyhton network for geometric deep learning-based prediction of the liver resection zone. 
The detailed description of the computation can be found n the article "Geometric Deep Learning Adapted to Prediction of Liver Resection Zone" by Joy Rakshit, Robert Kreher, Tobias Huber, Hauke Lang, Florentine Huettl and Sylvia
Saalfeld 2025. Please also consider (and cite) [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet](https://github.com/QingyongHu/RandLA-Net) since our approach is based on it.
